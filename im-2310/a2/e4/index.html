<!--DESIGN COMMENTS FOR EXPERIMENT 4 -->

<!-- In summary, I chose to add a playback speed button as if the user experience was listening to spoken dialogue, such as 
    a podcast or audiobook. A faster playback rate is designed to give the user the audio information faster, helping them reach 
    the goal of taking in information quickly, or on the go. This is in contrast to a music player, where the listner does not necessarily 
    need to absorb the content in a time-sensitive manner-->

<!-- The playback rate button was implemented using the .js file, while linking it to the buutton ID in the .html file. Playback rate was set at x2, and I initially
    made a x2 icon. I then chose to change the icon the the running/waling person as x2 was too fast for one playback rate button. Subsequently I changed 
    the playback rate to x1.5 -->

<!-- I chose the purple colour theme to represent the visual content on the media player. Should I have designed something that hosted multiple 
    pieces of visual content, I would have liked to generated some sort of colour theme that adapts to the most prominent colour in the video.
    I reference the purple theme to The Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast, in which this visual content match the atmosphere the DTFH podcast creates-->

<!-- I made the media player adapt to a thinner, smartphone style layout with media queries -->

<!-- The player buttons were boosted in size and a running/walking person icon was illustrated on Adobe Illustrator to signify the playback rate -->

<!-- A slight transition fade was placed upon the player buttons so as to make the user experience smoother. I also rounded the element corners with 
    the border-radius parametre for this smoothness reason. -->

<!-- The mute button was impemented with the assistance of Patrick -->
