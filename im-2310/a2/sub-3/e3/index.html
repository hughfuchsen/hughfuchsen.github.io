<!-- index.html -->

<!-- Updated the background colour and element colors to match that of the hosono.html -->
<!-- Created an animation and named it 'growBar' to signify a loading sequence. Made the colours change with the animation @keyframes. The colours land 
    onto the purple colour (main colour) to give the user a feeling of synchronicity and readiness for the page to update to hosono.html -->
<!-- Made the load link and hover transition the same as the header-transitions in hosono.html to make an easier association with button signifiers -->


<!-- hosono.hmtl -->

<!-- Made the header-transition:hover colour a lighter purple to signify a hovered button. Conversely, I made the header-transition:hover a slighty
    darker purple to the white text in dark-mode. The font-color of the header buttons were also inverted in order to be made visible  -->
<!-- I added a cursor to header-transition:hover to signify feedback a hovered button -->
<!-- Made a border radius transition upon header-transition:hover, changing the background colour as the border radius contracted 10 pixels. This is
    subsequently reversed upon un-hovering the element. -->
<!-- For the dark-mode transitions, the colours were updated in the .js script, along with the <a> element colours. I then added .css transitions
    for the colour variables in the .body-transition class of the style.css doc.. I did not feel it necessary to transition the <a> element colours as 
      the transition was already quite smooth. Hence I left the <a> elements to be instantly changing upon the mode switch operation -->
<!-- Added animated fading squares (div elements) to signal the next part of the pages information about Hosono -->

  PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK TO THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:
  1) <button> with the id of load-link on the loading page (index.html)
  2) <div> with the id of load-throbber on the loading page (index.html)
  3) <li> inside of the <ol> inside of the <nav> on the information page (hosono.html)
  4) <button> with the id of mode-button on the information page (hosono.html)
  5) switchModes() function - hint you can add a transition CSS property to the <body> and it will be inherited 
     by all the elements inside, so when custom CSS variables are changed it will apply transition

        Typically I'd use an <a> here but as we're faking a load time I'm using a <button> instead.  If it was an 
        <a> I would leave off the target attribute so that it would redirect the current tab.

        The function loadPageAfterDelay() is declared in the file fakeLoad.js - it takes a number value that sets the

        This is a div we're using for the throbber - if we wanted to do a % based loading bar there is an element 
        called <progress> but as this one is just indicating a wait rather than providing direct feedback on progress I've 
        opted for using a <div>.
