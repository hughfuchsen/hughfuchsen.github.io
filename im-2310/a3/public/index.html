<!-- Chosen adjective/principle pairing: Growing/Shrinking Agency -->

<!-- Explain the key parts of the interaction
    
    A bunch of different faces with a number of distinct faces amongst them. Click one of the distinct faces before the time bar grows to it's deadline.
    Each level makes the amount of distinct faces decrease, giving the user a sense of growing agency as they accomplish the interaction levels. 
    By the end, the users sense of agency has grown in proportion to the difficulty of the interaction.
    
    With the user's sense of agency growing as they accomplish the harder spotting tasks, 
    their actual "capacity of exerting power" is paradoxically shrinking

    - Specific plans for how it will guide your interaction design
        - Time bar
            - The time bar contributes to the design adjective and its principle: Growing Agency
            - Agency in the Miriam Webster dictionary: “the capacity, condition, or state of acting or of exerting power”
            - The time bar grows (upward) as time runs out, forcing the user to undergo a growth in their personal sense of agency in order to further 
                their "exploitation of the procedural and participatory properties" of the interaction.

            - This interaction is designed to give the user a growing sense of agency as they accomplish the harder spotting tasks.
              In other words, their "capacity of exerting power" needs to grow in order to complete the interaction.

    <h4 style="text-align: center;">HUGH F</h4>
    <br>
    <p style="margin: 2rem;">In my design, I explore the idea of growing agency. Clicking one of the distinct ‘happy’ faces before the time bar 
        grows to its deadline will let the user progress to the next level. Each level makes the amount of distinct faces decrease, giving the user 
        a sense of growing agency as they accomplish the interaction levels. By the end, the user’s sense of agency has grown in proportion to the 
        difficulty of the interaction.
        <br>
        I set out on my design journey ideating upon the previous experiments in Assignment 2 of my Interactive Media course at RMIT. 
        Having grasped certain Javascript functions, such as CSS attribute retrieval and SetTimeout(), I was able to build code with varying 
        aspects as follows:
        <br>
        <br>
        Time Bar
        <br>
        <br>
        The time bar grows upward as time runs out, forcing the user to undergo a growth in their personal sense of agency in order to further 
        their "exploitation of the procedural and participatory properties" of the interaction. (Murray, 2012)
        I made the time bar red in order to foster a sense of urgency, whilst making the remaining theme a light blue to contrast the time bar.

        Face (.png) Generation
        <br>
        <br>
        Each "happy" face image indicates interactivity when the user's cursor hovers over it, as evidenced by the cursor changing. 
        Upon clicking a ‘happy’ face, the next level begins. With a growing scarcity of ‘happy’ faces in each level, along with a shorter time to find the face, the probability of successfully completing the level becomes narrower. The user’s sense of agency increases upon their accomplishment. 
        The locations of the faces on the page are designed to pop up randomly over a set amount of time. The randomness affords the 
        ability to repeat the interaction at a consistent level of difficulty in order to keep the growing sense of agency constant.

        <br>
        Page Transitions
        <br>
        <br>
        Each level begins with a prompt that is designed to discourage the user’s agency so as to force them to be more focused 
        upon entry to the next level. In other words, their "capacity of exerting power" 
        (Merriam-Webster 2023) needs to grow in order to complete the interaction.
        Every button has a color transition upon hover to indicate interactivity.

        Javascript Optimisation 
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 2rem;">   
        Initially I had 10 levels, all with their own HTML pages. The interaction was smoothly loading between pages. 
        However, it was made apparent that the user could easily re-load the HTML page and replay any level at any time. 
        In the interest of exploring the idea of growing agency it was crucial that I made the user’s agency solely dependent 
        upon the designed interaction. 
        
        In order to make this happen, I put all of the interaction’s HTML code onto one page. I then built a function that set a 
        desired element’s display to be visible, while setting the display of other elements to ‘none’. Now I have better control 
        over the user’s interaction. This approach in design does not afford cheating, and helps foster a sense of growing agency.
