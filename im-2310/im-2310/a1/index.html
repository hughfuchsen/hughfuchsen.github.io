    <h1>hugh's TETRAGEDDON experience</h1>
<div>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>what was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</li></h3>
        <p>when first interacting with the experience, i noticed all of the floating buttons drifing down the page. 
            I also paid attention to the monkey with their finger on the red button. 
        </p>

        <h3><li>spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</li></h3>
        <p>action list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>tried to move the mouse in order to catch and click a button</li>
            <li>was pleasantly ammused with the response of each button</li>
            <li>clicked on a link that opened a new tab, prompting me to type my scream into the void</li>
            <li>typed 'AAAAAA' into the prompt. my scream was not enough to fill the void</li>
            <li>typed in 'AAAAAA' a few more times, and then received an award for my scream</li>
            <li>navigated back into the home tab</li>
            <li>navigated to the 'user licence agreement' page</li>
            <li>read the 'user licence agreement' page</li>
            <li>navigated back to the home screen</li>
            <li>clicked on more floating boxes</li>
            <li>received pop-up notifications from the boxes with humourous message</li>
            <li>was directed to a page telling me i was being attacked by computer zombies</li>
            <li>all of a sudden, after clicking a button, i was directed to a new window telling me i had been saved by some computer virus angel</li>
            <li>by this stage, i went and closed all of the new tabs that had opened, then proceeded back to the home page</li>

        </ul>

        <h3><li>what part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</li></h3>
        <p>besides reading the 'user licence agreement', most of my time was spent appreciating the screaming module and its cute sound design</p>

        <h3><li>what was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</li></h3>
        <p>the most common action was deciding which elusive button to click, based on my early understanding that i had no idea where the button would lead me</p>

        <h3><li>what is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</li></h3>
        <p>my impression of the designer's primary goal was to showcase the chaos and frustration of 1990's 
            user interface design.
        </p>

        <h3><li>what is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</li></h3>
        <p>the experience communicates its primary goal with an apocalyptic, yet light-hearted theme. hints of serious legal documents, mixed with existential humour 
            subject the user to the what it would have felt like to be stressed out in 1997 while trying to operate a relatively dysfunctional piece of technology</p>

        <h3><li>what is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (for how long and how many different times)</li></h3>
        <p>my impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time is to click into about two new tabs, then take a break and start again from the home page
            all-in-all, for about one minute at a time, just because of the density of information and stimulation.
        </p>

        <h3><li>what is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</li></h3>
        <p>based on my idea that TETRAGEDDON is designed to frustrate the user, the interactive experience communicates 
            how it should be interacted with over time in relation to however long it takes the user to rage-quit the program.</p>

        <h3><li>what other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</li></h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>desktop computer interfaces in the 1990's</li>
            <li>cookies and cookie notifications - specifically how annoying cookies can be</li>
            <li>2d RPG video games from the 1990's</li>
            <li>comic books (dialogue text)</li>
            <li>halloween culture</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h3><li>what does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</li></h3>
        <p>the references suggest i should proceed with playful humour and curiosity, should i want to enjoy a long experience of TETRAGEDDON.</p>

        <h3><li>what does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</li></h3>
        <p>on the condition that the user is somebody who lived in the 1990's, the references suggest feelings of nostalgia, mixed with a joking resentment of the technology. 
            had the user not experienced life in the era of the references, their operation of the program would consist of confusion, frustration, and disgust of 
            the poor design choice; this would be due having no historical contextual understanding of the referenced material. 
            </p>

        <h3><li>what is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</li></h3>
        <p>being frustrating by design, this question should be what the most pleasant element is. (edit: i later realised this was the next question!) to answer it anyway, the most frustrating element in TETRAGEDDON
            is definitely the elusive buttons. this is frustrating because there is already so much stimulating the experience. not being able to catch the buttons 
            adds a sense of helpnessness, as if nothing will ever really be achieved on the website by the user.</p>


        <h3><li>what is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</li></h3>
        <p>
            the most pleasant and satisfying element is the incredibly cute sound design, consisting of the little screaming module, and the cute ghost RPG video game. this is 
            so satisfying because it brings softness and joy amid the fire, death, destruction and sheer chaos of the rest of the experience; a nice contrast, if you will!
